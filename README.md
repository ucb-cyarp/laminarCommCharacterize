Characterize Communication Patterns used by Laminar

This is primarily a revision and extension of the core-core benchmark in https://github.com/ucb-cyarp/benchmarking

It is written purely in C to best match the code emitted by Laminar.  It is also simplified.

It focuses on measuring the achieved data rates of the communication style used by Laminar.
